# üêü¬†Fishbait API Guide
This guide will describe how to use Fishbait via its API. This is the same API
that is used by the web app at [fishbait.marzuk.io](http://fishbait.marzuk.io)

The API gives you access to a version of Fishbait that is hosted in the cloud
and that has been trained using the ["big" hyperparameters](/src/ai/mccfr/hyperparameters.h.big).


## Getting Started
The Fishbait API is hosted at [fishbait.marzuk.io/api](http://fishbait.marzuk.io/api).
If you navigate to this page, you should get a response that says `FISHBAIT API Running`.
This indicates that the API is up and ready to go.

To start using the Fishbait API, you‚Äôll need a session ID. To get a session ID,
send a `GET` request to the `/new-session` endpoint (so this will be at
`fishbait.marzuk.io/api/new-session`).

If the request succeeds, you will get a blank response and HTTP status code
`200`. The response will also set the `session_id` cookie to your new session
id. This indicates you're good to go! You'll need to provide this cookie upon
subsequent requests.

All new sessions start with the default game data (10,000 chips per player,
100/200 blinds). If you wish to change this, you can [reset](#post-reset) your
game.


## Using Routes
Once you have a session id cookie, you can begin to use the [routes](#routes) to
interact with your game and the AI.

## Routes

### GET `/state`
- **Description**: Fetch the current state of the game.
- **Returns**: The current [game state object](#game-state-object).

### POST `/set-hand`
- **Description**: Sets the hand of `player_needs_hand`
- **Returns**: The [game state object](#game-state-object) after the hand has
  been set.
- **Expected Body**: JSON
  - **`hand`**
    - **Type**: `[int or null]`
    - **Description**: An array of 2 [hand numbers](#hand-numbering--card-indexing)
      that represent the hand of the `player_needs_hand`. Or an array of 2 nulls
      if `player_needs_hand` is mucking their hand.

### POST `/apply`
- **Description**: Plays the given action for `acting_player`
- **Returns**: The [game state object](#game-state-object) after the action has
  been played.
- **Expected Body**: JSON
  - **`action`**
    - **Type**: `string`
    - **Enum**: `Fold`, `Check`, `Call`, `Bet`, `All In`
  - **`size`**
    - **Type**: `integer or null`
    - **Description**: The amount of chips that is being bet if the `action` is
      `Bet`. Otherwise any arbitrary value or `null` is fine.

### POST `/set-board`
- **Description**: Sets the `board` to the given cards.
- **Returns**: The [game state object](#game-state-object) after the board has
  been set.
- **Expected Body**: JSON
  - **`board`**
    - **Type**: `[int or null]`
    - **Description**: An array of 5 [hand numbers](#hand-numbering--card-indexing)
      that represent the cards on the `board`. Board cards that have yet to be
      revealed can be set to `null`.

      Note that Fishbait will only consider cards legally available during the
      current round when making its decision‚Äîi.e. if you define all 5 board
      cards on the flop, Fishbait will only use the first 3 to calculate its
      strategy. So it is safe to define all 5 board cards at the beginning of
      the game if you'd like.

### POST `/new-hand`
- **Description**: At the end of a hand, the winner(s) are automatically awarded
  the appropriate reward from the pot and the hand concludes. This is indicated
  by `pot=0` and `in_progress=false`.

  You can call this route at that point to set up the game for the next hand.
  The cards will be cleared, the button will be rotated one position, and blinds
  will be posted.

  **NOTE**: If you call this endpoint in the middle of a hand before the pot is
  awarded, behavior is undefined. You will likely need to [reset](#post-reset)
  your game.
- **Returns**: The [game state object](#game-state-object) at the start of the
  new hand.

### POST `/reset`
- **Description**: Hard reset of the game state. Wipes all hands, cards, bets
  and actions and starts a new game from the given parameters.
- **Returns**: The [game state object](#game-state-object) at the start of the
  new game.
- **Expected Body**: JSON

## Troubleshooting

### ServerOverloadedError
When requesting a session, if the server is at capacity, you will get the
following JSON response along with status code `503`:
```json
{
  "error_message": "Our servers are currently overloaded because we are in beta and our capacity is limited. Please try again in 30 minutes.",
  "error_code": "ServerOverloadedError"
}
```

If this happens, try again later when the server may have free capacity.
Fishbait currently supports sessions of at least 30 minutes for up to 1000 users
at a time. This can be scaled up if needed.

### MissingSessionIdError
If you fail to provide a session id cookie on a route that requires it, you'll
get the following JSON response along with status code `400`:
```json
{
  "error_message": "A session ID was not provided.",
  "error_code": "MissingSessionIdError"
}
```

### UnknownSessionIdError
If the server is at capacity, your session may be deleted after 30 minutes to
make space for other users. If this happens, your requests will be responded to
with the following JSON along with status code `404`:
```json
{
  "error_message": "The provided session id was not found.",
  "error_code": "UnknownSessionIdError"
}
```

In this case, try requesting a new session id. Note that if your session is
deleted, your game data will also be deleted.

### ValidationError
If the JSON object you supply to a route is in an unexpected format, you will be
given the following error along with status code `400`:
```json
{
  "error_message": "The given input was not valid",
  "error_code": "ValidationError"
}
```

### InvalidStateTransitionError
If an invalid or illegal operation is requested‚Äîfor example, raising an amount
below the minimum raise‚Äîyou will be given the following error along with status
code `400`:
```json
{
  "error_message": "The requested operation is invalid in the current game state",
  "error_code": "InvalidStateTransitionError"
}
```
