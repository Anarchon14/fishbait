## Build Steps
From the root directory:

1. `mkdir -p build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
    - Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` to debug with gdb or lldb.
    - Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` to run in release mode. Release
      mode will add optimizations that make the code run faster.
    - `cmake ..` will use the last value specified for `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. If no
      value is specified, it will use release mode by default.
4. `make`
    - Note: You can also run `make <target>` to only build a specific part of
      the project where `<target>` is one of the following:
      - `clustering.out`
      - `deck`
      - `hand_strengths`
      - `hand_strengths.out`
      - `poker_engine`
      - `poker_demo.out`
      - `sequence_table`
      - `tests.out`

All executables will now be located in `build/bin`. So, for example, to execute
`poker_demo.out`, simply run `./bin/poker_demo.out` from the `build` directory.
