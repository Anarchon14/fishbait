# Fishbait üêü
**F**ully **I**nsightful **S**uperhuman **H**old'em **B**ot with
**A**rtificially **I**ntelligent **T**hought. An AI agent designed to play
poker. Inspired by the Pluribus poker bot developed by CMU and Facebook.

## Build Steps
From the root directory:

1. Create the build folder: `mkdir -p build`
2. Navigate to the build folder: `cd build`
3. Generate the build files: `cmake <options> ..`
    * Possible Options:
        * `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<c-compiler>` and 
          `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<cpp-compiler>`
        * `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to debug with gdb or lldb.
        * `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to run in release mode. Release mode
          will add optimizations that makes the code run faster.
        * `-DTGT_SYSTEM=Graviton2` for AWS Graviton2 optimizations.
        * `-DCORES=<core_count>` to instruct parallel algorithms to use
          `<core_count>` cores.
4. Create a folder for clustering files: `mkdir -p out/clustering`
5. Download the card cluster files to the newly created folder

   * [River](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNSfJKBzAZ2CQGYvplQqjAXPHIkbe3sI/view?usp=sharing)
6. Build the code: `cmake --build .`
   * `cmake --build . -- -j CORES` to run a parallel build.

All executables will now be located in `build/bin`. So, for example, to execute
`poker_demo.out`, simply run `./bin/poker_demo.out` from the `build` directory.

## Deployment
1. Build the project as detailed above.
2. Copy `src/interface/fishbait.nginx.example` to
   `/etc/nginx/sites-available/fishbait.nginx` and replace the placeholders
     * Set the `host` property to the absolute path of
       `build/src/interface/build`
     * Set the `server_name` property to be whatever url the interface is to be
       deployed on.
3. `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fishbait.nginx /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/fishbait.nginx`
4. `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
5. Configure `src/interface/api/config.ini`
6. Copy `src/interface/fishbait.service.example` to
   `/etc/systemd/system/fishbait.service` and replace the placeholders
     * Set the `WorkingDirectory` to the absolute path of `src/interface`
     * Set the placeholder in `ExecStart` to be the absolute path of
       `build/src/interface/venv/bin/gunicorn`
7. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
8. `sudo systemctl start fishbait`
9. Setup https/ssl with the appropriate
   [certbot instructions](https://certbot.eff.org/)

## Testing
Unit tests can be run with `./bin/tests.out` from the `build` directory.
If the project is built in debug mode, a code coverage report can be generated
with `make coverage` from the `build` directory. `gcov` and `lcov` need to be
installed for code coverage.

## Requirements
- C++17
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) >= 3.20
- [Gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) (for code coverage)
- [LCOV](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) (for code coverage)
- Python 3
- [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint) (runs during the pre-commit
  hook)
- [pylint](https://pylint.org) (runs during the pre-commit hook)
- nginx (to deploy the interface)
